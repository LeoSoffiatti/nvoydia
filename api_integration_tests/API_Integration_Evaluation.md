# API Integration Tests - Assignment 4.1 Evaluation

**Date:** September 19, 2024  
**Consultant:** Aakash Suresh  
**Project:** NVoydia Dashboard API Integration  

## Executive Summary

This evaluation tests the feasibility of integrating live data sources for the NVoydia dashboard. We tested multiple sources including Piloterr Crunchbase API, TechCrunch, Y Combinator, and NewsAPI. The results show significant challenges with API access and data extraction, requiring alternative approaches for data collection.

## Sources Tested

### 1. Piloterr Crunchbase API
**Source:** https://www.piloterr.com/library/crunchbase-company-info  
**API Key:** 7a8307b0-0e61-4457-a31a-4dc0dcb93b88  

#### Data Fields Available
- **Intended Fields:** Company name, description, industry, founded year, employee count, location, website, LinkedIn URL, total funding, last funding date, investors
- **Actual Access:** No working endpoints found

#### Format
- **Expected:** Structured JSON API responses
- **Actual:** API endpoints not accessible

#### Integration Feasibility
- **Weekly Dashboard Updates:** ❌ Not feasible
- **Reason:** API endpoints are not publicly accessible or may require different authentication method

#### Limitations
1. **API Endpoint Issues:** No working endpoints found at standard API URLs
2. **Authentication Method:** Standard Bearer token and API key methods failed
3. **Documentation:** Limited public documentation available
4. **Service Availability:** Service may be down or require different access method

#### Manual Enrichment Potential
- **Worth Manual Pull:** ⚠️ Uncertain - would need to verify actual API access
- **Recommendation:** Contact Piloterr support for proper API documentation

### 2. TechCrunch Healthtech Articles
**Source:** https://techcrunch.com/tag/healthtech/

#### Data Fields Available
- **Intended Fields:** Article title, URL, publication date, content summary
- **Actual Access:** HTML scraping attempted but no articles extracted

#### Format
- **Expected:** HTML articles with structured content
- **Actual:** Complex HTML structure requiring advanced parsing

#### Integration Feasibility
- **Weekly Dashboard Updates:** ⚠️ Partially feasible with improved scraping
- **Reason:** Requires more sophisticated HTML parsing and may face anti-bot measures

#### Limitations
1. **HTML Structure:** Complex, dynamic content requiring advanced parsing
2. **Anti-Bot Measures:** May implement rate limiting or blocking
3. **Content Structure:** Articles may not have consistent structure
4. **Legal Considerations:** Scraping terms of service compliance needed

#### Manual Enrichment Potential
- **Worth Manual Pull:** ✅ Yes - high-quality healthtech content
- **Recommendation:** Implement RSS feed parsing or contact TechCrunch for API access

---

### 3. Y Combinator Healthcare Companies
**Source:** https://www.ycombinator.com/companies/industry/healthcare/san-francisco-bay-area

#### Data Fields Available
- **Intended Fields:** Company name, description, founding year, location, website, funding status
- **Actual Access:** HTML scraping attempted but no companies extracted

#### Format
- **Expected:** Structured company listings
- **Actual:** Dynamic content requiring JavaScript rendering

#### Integration Feasibility
- **Weekly Dashboard Updates:** ⚠️ Partially feasible with Selenium/Playwright
- **Reason:** Requires JavaScript rendering for dynamic content

#### Limitations
1. **Dynamic Content:** Requires JavaScript rendering (Selenium/Playwright)
2. **Rate Limiting:** May implement anti-scraping measures
3. **Data Structure:** Inconsistent company listing formats
4. **Geographic Limitation:** Limited to San Francisco Bay Area

#### Manual Enrichment Potential
- **Worth Manual Pull:** ✅ Yes - high-quality startup data
- **Recommendation:** Use Selenium/Playwright for dynamic content or manual data entry

---

### 4. NewsAPI Healthtech News
**Source:** https://newsapi.org/

#### Data Fields Available
- **Intended Fields:** Article title, URL, publication date, source, content summary
- **Actual Access:** No API key provided for testing

#### Format
- **Expected:** Structured JSON API responses
- **Actual:** Not tested due to missing API key

#### Integration Feasibility
- **Weekly Dashboard Updates:** ✅ Highly feasible
- **Reason:** Professional API with good documentation

#### Limitations
1. **API Key Required:** Free tier available but requires registration
2. **Rate Limits:** Free tier has limited requests per day
3. **Content Quality:** Varies by source publication
4. **Cost:** Paid tiers required for production use

#### Manual Enrichment Potential
- **Worth Manual Pull:** ✅ Yes - comprehensive news coverage
- **Recommendation:** Get free API key and test integration

## Alternative Data Sources Recommendations

### 1. Crunchbase Direct API
- **Source:** https://data.crunchbase.com/
- **Advantages:** Official API, comprehensive data
- **Limitations:** Expensive, requires approval
- **Feasibility:** High for production use

### 2. AngelList/Wellfound API
- **Source:** https://wellfound.com/
- **Advantages:** Startup-focused, good healthtech coverage
- **Limitations:** Limited API access
- **Feasibility:** Medium

### 3. RSS Feeds
- **Sources:** TechCrunch RSS, MobiHealthNews RSS, FierceBiotech RSS
- **Advantages:** Free, reliable, structured
- **Limitations:** Limited data fields
- **Feasibility:** High

### 4. Manual Data Collection
- **Approach:** Curated lists from industry reports, LinkedIn, company websites
- **Advantages:** High data quality, specific to needs
- **Limitations:** Time-intensive, not scalable
- **Feasibility:** High for MVP

## Recommended Implementation Strategy

### Phase 1: MVP Data Collection (Immediate)
1. **Manual Data Entry:** Create curated list of 50-100 healthtech companies
2. **RSS Feed Integration:** Implement RSS parsing for news updates
3. **Static Data:** Use existing databases and industry reports

### Phase 2: Semi-Automated Collection (Short-term)
1. **NewsAPI Integration:** Implement NewsAPI for news aggregation
2. **Enhanced Scraping:** Use Selenium/Playwright for dynamic content
3. **Data Validation:** Implement quality checks and deduplication

### Phase 3: Full Automation (Long-term)
1. **Professional APIs:** Integrate Crunchbase or similar paid services
2. **Machine Learning:** Implement content classification and extraction
3. **Real-time Updates:** Automated data pipeline with monitoring

## Technical Implementation Notes

### Data Collection Scripts Created
1. **`piloterr_crunchbase_test.py`:** Comprehensive API testing with multiple endpoint attempts
2. **`additional_sources_test.py`:** Multi-source scraping with error handling
3. **Both scripts include:** Error handling, rate limiting, data validation, and result logging

### Database Integration
- **Current Backend:** FastAPI with SQLAlchemy 2.0
- **Database:** SQLite (development) / PostgreSQL (production)
- **Data Models:** Companies, News, Investments, Rankings, VCs, People

### API Endpoints Ready
- **Companies:** `/companies` with filtering and pagination
- **News:** `/news` with date ranges and industry filtering
- **VCs:** `/vcs` with scoring and ranking
- **All endpoints:** Include pagination, filtering, and sorting

## Conclusion

While the primary API sources (Piloterr Crunchbase) were not accessible, the evaluation provides a clear path forward for data collection. The recommended approach combines manual curation for MVP with gradual automation using RSS feeds and professional APIs.

**Next Steps:**
1. Implement RSS feed parsing for news updates
2. Create manual data entry process for company information
3. Test NewsAPI integration with free tier
4. Develop data validation and quality assurance processes

**Estimated Timeline:**
- **MVP Data Collection:** 1-2 weeks
- **Semi-Automated Pipeline:** 3-4 weeks
- **Full Automation:** 6-8 weeks

This approach ensures the dashboard can be delivered on time while building toward a scalable, automated data collection system.
